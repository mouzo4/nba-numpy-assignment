NBA statistics analysis using Python and NumPy for a class assignment
NBA NumPy Assignment

This project uses Python and NumPy to analyze NBA player statistics.
The goal is to practice numeric data analysis using NumPy arrays.

In this project, I calculated:
- Field goal accuracy
- Three point accuracy
- Free throw accuracy
- Points per minute
- Overall shooting accuracy
- Average blocks per game
- Average steals per game

I also created lists of the top 100 players and their seasons for each metric.

The data was loaded into NumPy arrays and basic math operations were used.
Simple checks were added to avoid division by zero.

I used ChatGPT to help me understand the assignment instructions,
debug Python code, and write this README file.
The chat log is included in this repository.
